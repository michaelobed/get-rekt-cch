# Get Rekt: CCH Edition
A Creative Christian Hangout-exclusive version of the Get Rekt engine.
Get Rekt is a customisable, turn-based fighting game that grows whenever I have spare time. Now you can chancla your friends guilt-free! 🙃

## Okay yeah great don't care I want to play! 😆
Alright, alright!
See the _Releases_ heading on the right? Click on the latest release, then under _Assets_, choose the ZIP folder that's right for you (win for Windows, mac for Mac, obviously). Download, unzip and you're ready to play!

## How it work doe? 🤔
Almost every computer has a way of displaying text in a little window called a console. This just uses that combined with some (hopefully) clever game logic to do its thing.

## How you wo-...sorry, how do you play? 🤨
Every game starts with two (for now) players: you both pick your character, three moves and a single-use, high-damage move called a super.
Then, once you've both done that, there are no controls to learn - just enter a number from a list of characters or moves, hit Enter, et voilà! Tax fraud!

## I don't like the character choices/moves/the game making fun of me when I miss. 😠
That's okay! See that folder called `json`? That contains three files, called `moves`, `roster` and `phrases`, which let you add, remove and edit all possible moves, characters and those odd things the game says when your character tries to hit you with a newspaper and misses!

### Cool things you can do with moves
- Moves can be unique to specific characters by setting `uniqueTo` for a move. That way, Russ gets a Sax Solo! 😎
- Moves can cause self-damage too to really up the stakes!
- As of v1.1, moves have properties now! I should write a guide for this eventually, but for now, try different moves out and see what happens...

### Cool things you can do with characters
- Characters can have a win action or a win phrase which gets shown when they win. Simply give `winAction` or `winPhrase` (or both!) a value. _\*gives gun fingers\*_

## What's next for Get Rekt? 🤩
No idea! ~~Roster changes~~, ~~moves with special conditions~~, maybe even online play...these are all ideas I've had at some point, but remember, this is a for-funsies project! I can only devote so much time to this, but if you have any further questions, ideas or comments though, let me know!
