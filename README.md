## Okay yeah great don't care I want to play! ðŸ˜†
Alright, alright! (TODO: Add download instructions)

## How it work doe? ðŸ¤”
Almost every computer has a way of displaying text in a little window called a console. This just uses that combined with some (hopefully) clever game logic to do its thing.

## How you wo-...sorry, how do you play? ðŸ¤¨
Every game starts with two (for now) players: you both pick your character, three moves and a single-use, high-damage move called a super.
Then, once you've both done that, there are no controls to learn - just enter a number from a list of characters or moves, hit Enter, et voilÃ ! Tax fraud!

## I don't like the character choices/moves/the game making fun of me when I miss. ðŸ˜ 
That's okay! See that folder called `json`? That contains three files, called `moves`, `roster` and `phrases`, which let you add, remove and edit all possible moves, characters and those odd things the game says when your character tries to hit you with a newspaper and misses!

### Cool things you can do with moves
- Moves can be unique to specific characters by setting `uniqueTo` for a move. That way, Russ gets a Sax Solo! ðŸ˜Ž
- Moves can cause self-damage too to really up the stakes!

### Cool things you can do with characters
- Characters can have a win action or a win phrase which gets shown when they win. Simply give `winAction` or `winPhrase` (or both!) a value. _\*gives gun fingers\*_
